// javascript runtime environment is consist of :-
// js engine
// api
// cq
// mq and many more

// but javascript env is not possible without js engine means it is heart of javascript env

// js engine is not a machine

// what happen inside js engine
// code==> parsing ==> compilation ==> execution

// code is broken down into tokens.
// then syntext parser take the code and convert it into AST (anstract syntex tree)

// after ast compilation stage come
// js behave like the interpreter as well as compile language it mostly depend upon js engine
// i.e, we call in JIT just in time compilation
// it uses compiler as well as interpreter to run your code


// our ast code is comnverted into byte code using interpretter and then this code move to execution it take help of compiler to optimise the code on the runtime

// in some js engine aot ahead of time compilation 
//and the above compilation is not possible without the help of memory head and call stack
