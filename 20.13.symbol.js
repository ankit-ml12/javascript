/*

Symbol - It is a new data type introduced in the ES6 version of javascript. It is used to store an anonymous and unique value.

Primitive :- story only one value and 
Nonprimitive:- store more value


//Hoisting
Hoisting is the default behaviour of javascript where all the variable and function declarations are moved on top.


This means that irrespective of where the variables and functions are declared, they are moved on top of the scope. The scope can be both local and global.


5. Difference between var and let keyword in javascript.

From the very beginning, the 'var' keyword was used in JavaScript programming whereas the keyword 'let' was just added in 2015.
The keyword 'Var' has a function scope. Anywhere in the function, the variable specified using var is accessible but in ‘let’ the scope of a variable declared with the 'let' keyword is limited to the block in which it is declared. Let's start with a Block Scope.
In ECMAScript 2015, let and const are hoisted but not initialized. Referencing the variable in the block before the variable declaration results in a ReferenceError because the variable is in a "temporal dead zone" from the start of the block until the declaration is processed

An Immediately Invoked Function ( known as IIFE and pronounced as IIFY) is a function that runs as soon as it is defined.
